# README Generator

## Description

This project was built to make it easier to create README templates filled with actual project information. It was also a great opportunity to practice and get better with Node, NPM, and Inquirer. The goal was to make a simple to use README template that uses a dialogue to fill in all important information for filling in a professional README file.

## Features

- Generates a README file using user entered information
- Ability to include or exclude different sections based on responses
- Full README template with a variety of possible sections

## Installation

* Ensure Node and npm are installed
* Run 'npm i' to install required dependencies
* Run 'npm start' or 'Node index.js' to start the program

## Usage

This program can be used to create a starting template for a README file to be included with any project. The generated file is a simple markdown file, and can be further modified to meet your particular needs. Things like screenshots and links will need to be added manually, as those are not able to be generated through this program at this time.

Note: This README file was created using the program, with only minor edits (screenshots, links, proofing).
